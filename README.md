# Introduction

This currently forms part of the documentation for the CE Store but probably isn't the place you want to look first when trying to find information and documentation.

Please see:
* [CE Store on GitHub](https://github.com/ce-store/ce-store)
* [CE Store GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ce-store/ce-store/wiki)
* The `/ce-store/doc/index.html` link on your own CE Store instance
